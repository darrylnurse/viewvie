# Viewvie!

So glad you came!

Let's get started.

First, fork this repo, so you can have your own personal playground.

Then, use ```git clone <forked_repo_link>``` in the terminal of your preferred IDE.

Let's get our project dependencies set up with ```npm run install-all```.

That covers our NodeJs dependencies. Time for our Python dependencies.

Now, open your terminal. You can do this by hitting ```Win  + R```, typing 'cmd' and hitting enter.

Run ```python -m venv viewvie  ``` in your CLI to initialize the virtual environment.

This will create a virtual environment file (named viewvie) in your user directory.

Use ```viewvie\Scripts\activate``` in your CLI to activate the virtual environment.

This is where we will install dependencies for our embedder module.

Install the python dependencies by running each one in your CLI: 

```pip install ...```

```pip install ...```

```pip install ...```

Now, we can safely run ```npm run start-all``` from the 'viewvie' directory to start the application. : )

If you need to, run ```npm run clear-media``` from the 'backend' directory to clear all uploads and output (it can get overwhelming).

Of course, project is missing .env file with Pinecone API key. Contact me for details.
