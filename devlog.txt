- hey guys
- please read
- if you want
- (i want you to)
- in package.json directly in backend directory, type is set to COMMONJS (require statements)
- this is for microservices files
- in database directory, it is set to MODULE (import statements)
- just something to bear in mind
- embedder file should actually probably be in database because of this.
- files between modules and database dont actually interact
- i should totes fix this eventually where microservices has its own package.json
- eventually..
- lol i did it

- 😝
- output file is in gitignore because it can get very large and is often deleted and recreated
- instructions to clear output are in video splitter file

- eventually endpoint of backend to return to front end will be a single string =)
- a few functions will have an optional parameter of metadata (probably an object : {"movieName" : "Fight Club"})
- so that overall system flow can be used for admin and user
- admin -> upload video -> beep bop *gear sounds* -> uploaded to backend WITH metadata
- user -> upload video -> beep bop *softer gear sounds* -> This movie is Fight Club! (metadata is not necessary)

- trying to work on the edge case of videos with black borders
- it is quite complex
- i would need to run ffplay in bash (it has no node support like ffmpeg)
- and get those values to put into my ffmpeg call
- maybe use child_process to run it and harvest the crop info using cropdetect
- maybe look into it in the future

- backend
- run express server to handle images
- serves images to chokidar which watches the server directory
- server receives images from video-splitter
- for now i will implement server for videos
- frontend -> post method -> server -> processing -> etc.

- frontend
- throws error if upload is not a video
- we can include image types later
- display error on front end
- lets do a route that contains the upload component and an error component
- after causing exception there is an ok button that returns you to upload page
- i included image types

- if splitting while uploading doesn't work then i will
- (die)
- setup a dir watcher for uploading
- IT WORKED RAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅

- got a bunch of git errors because i globally replaces the word output with upload??
- silly git

- tasks fo today
- test spawn-embedder.js command like input ✅
- package json script to run everything ✅
- routes for frontend (admin & user)

- i should have put dates for all these logs...
- admin and user pages use different server routes
- wait
- how about
- admin and user have different upload and output directories
- two different emitters for each directory
- work with emitter file to export a function that returns an emitter
- in video-server, we check the current path, /admin or /user and send to different directories based on that?
- ^ done, now just need to do two different emitters
- emitters should go in video-server file
- put pinecone in there too !
- could totally just rename that to server and put it in backend root
